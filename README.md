# Ron-swift

A Swift implementation of **Replicated Object Notation** (RON), a format for distributed live data.

[RON Official Website](http://replicated.cc)

Inspired by [swarm](https://github.com/gritzko/swarm) and [ron-cxx](https://github.com/gritzko/ron-cxx)

This implementation is an amalgamation of swarm's apis (sans GraphQL) and ron-cxx's internal binary representation. CloudKit support is on the schedule.
